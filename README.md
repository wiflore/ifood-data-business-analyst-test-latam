# ifood-data-business-analyst-test-latam

This case is used for hiring Data Analysts for the iFood Brain team. Instructions are in the pdf file. **For Senior Data Scientist application please add the following requirements:**

## ML model serving  
There are two goals for this exercise. The first one is to create an automated ML model training process. The second one is to create a Rest API that serves a ML model predictions.  

This process/pipeline should be generic enough to implement any models, with any data.  

Languages, frameworks, platforms are not a constraint, but your solution must be inside a docker image, docker compose, script or notebook ready to be run. Training a model or serving the Rest API structure should be as simple as running a script or something similar. 
You should also provide a README file on how to execute the training job, and how to request the API. There are a lot of tools that solve most of this problem; while you are free to use them, please try to balance the time you will save by using them with being able to show your programming skills by not using them as much.

## AWS infrastructure  

For this exercise, we would like for you to propose an AWS architecture.  A single page describing the resources needed is sufficient, although you are free to provide code if you like it. Please have in mind that this structure must be reliable, scalable and as cheap as possible without compromising the other two requisites.
